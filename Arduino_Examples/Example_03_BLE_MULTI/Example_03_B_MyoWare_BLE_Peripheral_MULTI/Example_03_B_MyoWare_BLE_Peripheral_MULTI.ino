  MyoWare Sensor BLE Peripheral MULTI SENSOR example

  This example reads 4 MyoWare Muscle Sensors, and then gets that data from this Artemis Redboard 
  (the Peripheral) to a second Redboard Artemis (the Central) over BLE.

  This Artemis, aka the "BLE Peripheral", will read the sensor on A0-A3.
  It will then store them in a single 32-bit variable, and then
  update that value to the "bluetooth bulliten board".

  Note, in BLE, you have services, characteristics and values.
  Read more about it here:
  
  https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/arduinoble/

  Note, before it begins reading the ADC and updating the data,
  It first sets up some BLE stuff:
    1. sets up as a peripheral
    2. sets up a service and characteristic (the data)
        -Note, Services and characteristics have custom 128-bit UUID,
        -These must match the UUIDs in the code on the central device.
    3. advertises itself

  In order for this example to work, you will need a second Artemis, and it will
  need to be programmed with the provided code specific to being a central device, 
  looking for this specific peripheral/service/characteristic.

  Note, both the service and the characteristic get unique UUIDs 
  (even though they are extremely close to being the same thing in this example)
  
  The second Artemis, aka the "BLE Central", will subscribe to the first board's 
  charactieristic, and check to see if the value has been updated. When it has been 
  updated, it will read it, parse it into 4 separate bytes, then print the values 
  to the serial terminal.

  Hardware:
  4 MyoWare Sensors, each with a Link Shield snapped on top.
  TRS cables from Link shields to Analog ports (A0-A3) of Arduino Shield.
  Arduino Shield pressed into Artemis Redboard.
  USB from Artemis to Computer.

  ** For consistent BT connection follow these steps:
  ** 1. Reset Peripheral
  ** 2. Wait 5 seconds
  ** 3. Reset Central
  ** 4. Enjoy BT connection
  **
  ** ArduinoBLE does not support RE-connecting two devices.
  ** If you loose connection, you must follow this hardware reset sequence again.

  This example code is in the public domain.
