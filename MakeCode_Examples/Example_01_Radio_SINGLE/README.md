MakeCode examples. Tested on two Micro:Bits and the MakeCode environment. We found it best to use a battery to transmit the data through the radio.


Drag and drop to your Micro:Bits (it will show up as an "external storage device" on your computer) to program. Or drag the .hex file into your MakeCode editor to import the example. The example code are also published through the following links.
