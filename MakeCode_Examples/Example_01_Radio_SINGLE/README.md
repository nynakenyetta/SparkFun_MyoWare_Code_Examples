MakeCode examples. Tested on two Micro:Bits and the MakeCode environment. We found it best to use a battery to transmit the data through the radio. Only run on a laptop using its battery. Do not plug in laptop charger/dock/monitor. Do not touch your laptop trackpad or keyboard while the MyoWare sensor is powered.

Drag and drop to your Micro:Bits (it will show up as an "external storage device" on your computer) to program. Or drag the .hex file into your MakeCode editor to import the example. The example code are also published through the following links.
